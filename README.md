#  6T SRAM Cell Design, Simulation & SNM Analysis Cadence Virtuoso

##  Abstract
Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) is one of the most significant memory devices used for storing data on-chip. SRAM plays a crucial role in VLSI chips due to its **high storage density**, **fast access time**, and suitability for **low-power applications**.  

This project presents the **design and implementation of a 6T SRAM cell** including:
- Schematic  
- DC Analysis  
- Layout  
- Static Noise Margin (SNM) analysis  

All simulations were performed using **Cadence Virtuoso** in a **90nm CMOS technology**. The SNM curves were analyzed to determine the stability and performance of the 6T SRAM cell.

##  Introduction
There are multiple types of semiconductor memory as shown in Fig. 1.

###  Fig 1 – Memory Hierarchy

SRAM is widely used in battery-operated and low-power devices because of its:
- Low area requirement  
- Low read/write delay  
- No refresh circuitry (unlike DRAM)  

SRAM stores data using **latching circuits**, and being volatile, it loses data when power is switched off.  

### Types of SRAM
1. Non-volatile SRAM  
2. Pseudostatic RAM  
3. By transistor type  
4. By feature  
5. By function  

A typical SRAM cell consists of **six MOSFETs (6T)** — four transistors form two cross-coupled inverters, and two act as access transistors.

##  Working
A 6T SRAM cell consists of:
- **Two cross-coupled inverters:** M1–M2 (inv1), M3–M4 (inv2)  
- **Two access transistors:** M5 & M6 connected to BL and BLB  

Data is stored as a stable state between Q and Q̅.

###  Write Operation
- WL = 1 (enabled)  
- BL and BLB are driven with input data  
- The cross-coupled inverters switch state and write the new data  

###  Read Operation
- WL = 1  
- BL and BLB are precharged to Vdd  
- Depending on stored value, one bitline discharges  
- Sense amplifier detects the differential voltage  

###  Hold Mode
- WL = 0  
- Access transistors OFF  
- Data at Q and Q̅ remains stable  

###  Important Condition  
The cell must be:
- **Weak enough** to be overwritten during write  
- **Strong enough** to retain data during read  

---

#  READ / WRITE OPERATION (Detailed)

##  READ Operation
- WL = HIGH  
- Consider stored data Q = 1, Q̅ = 0  
- BL remains HIGH  
- BLB discharges → sense amplifier outputs '1'  

Similarly, for Q = 0, Q̅ = 1:
- BL discharges  
- Sense amplifier outputs '0'  

---

##  WRITE Operation
Consider Q = 0, Q̅ = 1:
- WL = HIGH  
- BLB = 0 (forcing Q̅ low)  
- Potential difference flips the inverter state  
- New data Q = 1, Q̅ = 0 is written  

If BL and BLB do not create voltage difference → memory retains original value.

#  Static Noise Margin (SNM) Analysis

##  Theory
SNM determines **stability** of the SRAM cell.  
It is measured by plotting:

- The **VTC** of one inverter  
- The **inverse VTC** of the second inverter  

The two curves form the characteristic **“Butterfly Curve.”**

###  Fig 2 – Standard SRAM Structure

###  Fig 3 – SNM Butterfly Curve

### SNM Concept
- SNM is the **largest square** that can fit inside the butterfly lobes  
- Higher SNM → better noise immunity  
- SNM reduces during **read operation** and becomes minimum  

Noise source Vn shifts both VTC curves, reducing margin → risk of incorrect read.
